There's of course thousands of topics that we haven't covered, yet, but here's an overview of what might be the most relevant ones.

## 12.1 Trained A.I.

This is a field of AIs that need to be trained first (like neural networks)

This includes:
- evolutionary / genetical algorithms

## 12.2 A.I. Behavior States

This is a field of study that assesses how to have scripted A.I. that are adaptive, as in they change their behaviours not only based on their current state, but based on a history of previous states / events.

This includes:
- Finite State Machines (FSM, A Decision Tree that can react to events and switch State / Behavior)
- Hierarchical State Machines (Nested FSMs that reduce duplication and allow clean solutions for complex scenarios)
- Behavior Trees (allow change of state without transitions, instead uses Success, Failed and Running callbacks)
- Utility-Based System (Give scores to Actions, pick the most promising one)
- Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver (STRIPS, using Pre-Conditions and Post-Conditions per Action)
- Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP, add costs to actions, go from goal backwards to current state on shortest path)
